# Personal Post Highlighter for Tumblr

This is a Chrome browser extension that highlights a Tumblr blog's personally uploaded content. Tumblr has historically failed to provide this functionality to users, with many resorting to third party alternatives. 

See this quora answer: [On Tumblr, how do you view somebody's original posts?](https://www.quora.com/On-Tumblr-how-do-you-view-somebodys-original-posts)

> If what you’re referring to is how to find someone’s original posts in their blog, that can be difficult. Some people who keep their blogs organized tend to tag their own posts. If that’s the case with that “somebody” then just find which tag they’re using for their original posts and check it out. If they don’t tag their original posts then it’s going to be quite hard to find them without navigating all the way through their blog.  

There exist dedicated online tools which perform this function, such as [jetblackcode's post finder utility](https://jetblackcode.com/TumblrOriginalPostFinder). However, these tools are trying to deliver dedicated web experiences, and impose behavior such as pagination or limited filter/sort functionality. This extension enhances your native Tumblr experience, giving you the freedom to use Tumblr's own filter/sort functionality and UI. 

Add the extension to Chrome and personally uploaded posts will now show a green indicator. To toggle highlighting on/off for a blog, click the green application icon.
