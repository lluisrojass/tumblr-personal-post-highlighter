[Click here to add to chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tumblr-personal-post-high/lcfdkkodbhjgooidmbbofnafakdjnblk)

This is a Chrome browser extension that highlights a Tumblr blog's personally uploaded content as you browse. Tumblr has historically failed to provide this functionality to users. 


On Quora: [On Tumblr, how do you view somebody's original posts?](https://www.quora.com/On-Tumblr-how-do-you-view-somebodys-original-posts)  

> ...
> If what you’re referring to is how to find someone’s original posts in their blog, that can be difficult. Some people who keep their blogs organized tend to tag their own posts. If that’s the case with that “somebody” then just find which tag they’re using for their original posts and check it out. If they don’t tag their original posts then it’s going to be quite hard to find them without navigating all the way through their blog.  

## Why an extension?  

There exist serviceable tools which already solve this problem, e.g. [jetblackcode's post finder utility](https://jetblackcode.com/TumblrOriginalPostFinder). These tools exist as applications and deliver a dedicated UI with limited features. This extension enhances your native Tumblr experience, giving you the freedom to use Tumblr's own UI and functionality (e.g. pagination, filter/sort). 

## Usage

Add the extension to Chrome and personally uploaded posts will now show a green indicator on a blog's archive. To toggle highlighting on/off for a blog, click the green application icon.
